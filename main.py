# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP): Given a weighted graph G = (V, E), find the Hamiltonian circuit with the minimum weight.
# What I need to do is: (find the instances)
# 1) Initialization: Start from a random node in the graph.
# 2) Build the path: At each iteration, choose the next node to visit (among the ùëò closest nodes, sorted according to a greedy rule like the minimum distance).
# 3) Randomization: Randomly select the next node to visit among these ùëò nodes, to introduce uncertainty.
# Not executing this step could lead to a deterministic algorithm.
# 4) Continue: Repeat the process until all nodes are covered.
# 5) Close the circuit by returning to the starting node.
